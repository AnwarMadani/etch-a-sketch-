# Etch-A-Sketch

A digital Etch-A-Sketch application that allows users to draw on a grid using their mouse. Users can adjust the grid size and choose different colors to create custom designs. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases event handling and DOM manipulation to create an interactive drawing experience, mimicking the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.
